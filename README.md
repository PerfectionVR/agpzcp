# agpzcp

An 'Already Gone' server Project Zomboid Character Planner. AGPZCP in short.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Motivation

I've had my annoyances with finding out what kind of statistics one would have with particular traits, so decided to learn a little more about these mechanics by providing a planner that will elaborate certain stats.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
